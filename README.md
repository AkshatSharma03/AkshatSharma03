# 👋 Hi, I'm Akshat Sharma

**AI Developer | Cloud Systems Architect | CS & Economics @ Boston University**

I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and production-grade cloud infrastructure. My background in **Computer Science and Economics** allows me to build solutions that are technically sophisticated, ethically grounded, and economically viable.

### 🏛️ The Three Pillars of My Work

- **Engineering:** Architecting RAG pipelines, multi-agent systems (CrewAI/MCP), and full-stack AI applications.
- **Infrastructure:** Deploying and managing cloud-native environments across **AWS** and **Azure** using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Governance:** Researching and implementing bias-detection frameworks, AI-resilient pedagogy, and ethical LLM orchestration.

### 🔬 High-Impact Projects

#### 🤖 Terrier GPT (Enterprise RAG)
*Engineered a production-grade data pipeline to vectorize and index 5,000+ university documents into a FAISS database, powering an internal AI assistant (GPT-4.1) currently used across Boston University.*

#### 🏥 Mammo-CLIP (Medical AI Research)
*Fine-tuned multimodal AI models for breast cancer detection at the Batman Lab. Applied rigorous bias-detection methods to medical prediction systems to enhance clinical accuracy and model explainability.*

#### ✈️ GoNiva (AI-Powered Travel)
*Co-founded and architected a full-stack travel planning app using Next.js and LLMs. Developed a personalized recommendation engine that achieved a 10% higher engagement rate in A/B testing.*
